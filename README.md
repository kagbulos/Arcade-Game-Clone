Description
-----------
This is a clone of the classic game, Frogger.  Udacity provided the art assets and game engine. The player, enemies, and other game entities were coded in JavaScript's object-oriented pseudo-classical style. Additional game logic such as player and enemy interaction was added.

Most of the files were provided Udacity. My primary contribution to this project was in app.js where the Enemy and Player class are implemented as well as their corresponding logic.
